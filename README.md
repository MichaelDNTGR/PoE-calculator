# PoE Calculator

## Description

The PoE Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help users calculate Power over Ethernet (PoE) budgets for their network switches. It allows users to input the total PoE budget of their switch, along with the number of devices for each PoE class, and dynamically computes the leftover budget after considering the power consumption of the devices.

## Features

- Input total PoE budget of the switch.
- Enter the number of devices for each PoE class.
- Dynamically computes the leftover budget.
- View the PoE power allocation table.
- Toggle power management modes table.
- Step-by-step tutorial for new users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/poe-calculator.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Input the total PoE budget of your switch into the designated field.
2. Enter the number of devices for each PoE class in the respective input fields.
3. The calculator will dynamically compute the leftover budget after considering the power consumption of the devices.
4. View the PoE power allocation table to understand the power limits and standards for each class.
5. Toggle the power management modes table to learn about static and dynamic power management modes.
